# ReportSystem
My Spigot report system. Unfinished


# TODO
- [x] Allow ability for multiple reports to be made on the same person
- [ ] Allow admins to edit reports. This includes denying them, accepting them, and changing the reason.
- [ ] Allow ability to cancel reports made.
- [ ] Create notification system when someone joins the server and their report has been edited (Accepted/Denied).
- [ ] Possibly make this into a Bungee Plugin (not certain whether I want to do this)
- [ ] Discord Bot integration
- [ ] Convert the entire plugin to Kotlin (don't know any)


# Known bugs
- /rs settings doesn't update
- getReportedUser() and getReporter() in Report.java return null
