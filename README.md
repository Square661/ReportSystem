# ReportSystem
My Spigot report system. Unfinished


# TODO
- [x] Allow ability for multiple reports to be made on the same person (finished, see Known Bugs)
- [] Allow admins to edit reports. This includes denying them, accepting them, and changing the reason.
- [] Allow ability to cancel reports made.
- [] Create notification system when someone joins the server and their report has been edited (Accepted/Denied).
- [] Possibly make this into a Bungee Plugin (not certain whether I want to do this)
- [] Discord Bot integration


# Known bugs
- /report creates 2 reports if 1 report has already been created against a user.
- /rs settings doesn't update
